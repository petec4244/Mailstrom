# Mailstrom
A swirling vortex of cluttered email recovery.


I have a yahoo email that is full of junk mail, over 124,000 unread emails, and a gmail account that has over 24,000. I finally have time (due to my recent layoff) to address this issue and this is the code that will do it. I will create a few scripts, for each mailbox. They will sort,delete,unsubscribe, catagorize etc...
